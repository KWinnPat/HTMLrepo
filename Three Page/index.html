      <h2>Welcome to my Pokemon Teams!</h2>
      <p>
        Hi. This was sparked by a question by one of my friends, so here you go.
        And because I'm indecisive, I made three teams. Disclaimer: Each team
        has a Paradox Pokemon or Mythical. For some fun variety.
      </p>
      <h3>Team Types</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dragon</li>
        <li>Fairy</li>
        <li>Ice</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I also made a few outfits to go with them. Because I also really love
        fashion. Enjoy!
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, also for funzies. Have a fancam of my favorite VGC player and Main
        Character of Life: Wolfe Glick. He recently won his Tenth Regional. And
        then went on to win the European International Championships. Like I
        said, Main Character of Life.
